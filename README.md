Simple python script that when ran constantly checks a specific folder to see if any of the files have been updated. As soon as it detects that a files been updated it uploads the latest contents of the specified directory to the github repository of your choice.

In a sense, you can convert a folder on your desktop to a local repository, that automatically uploads to your github repository, instantly.
